Subject: Proposal for LLM Integration in TIP Project - Decision Required

Dear [Appropriate Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to propose the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into our TIP project within the SCB network. After careful consideration, I've identified two potential approaches and would like to present their respective advantages and disadvantages for your review.

1. Online LLM Service (AzureOpenAI or OpenAI)

Advantages:
- Minimal deployment and maintenance overhead
- Robust feature set including function calling, vision support, and multimodal capabilities
- Flexibility to switch between models for use case experimentation and accuracy optimization
- High accuracy and performance

Disadvantage:
- Cost implications

2. Open Source LLM

This approach would involve using models like Llama 3, Mistral, or Gemma, requiring:
a) Onboarding of Ollama tool for LLM model execution
b) Manual download of models from Hugging Face
c) GPU instance for efficient response generation

Advantages:
- No direct service costs

Disadvantages:
- Potentially lower accuracy compared to commercial solutions
- Manual setup and maintenance required for each model
- Limited support for advanced features (e.g., assistants, function calling, vision) in some models
- Ongoing maintenance and manual upgrades for new features and models

Recommendation:
Given our project's needs and resource allocation, I strongly recommend opting for an LLM service such as Azure OpenAI. This choice would allow us to focus our efforts on development rather than infrastructure management and model maintenance.

Implementation Libraries:
To implement our LLM solution, we have several powerful libraries at our disposal:
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- AutoGen
- CrewAI

We will select the most appropriate library based on our specific use cases and requirements. Each of these libraries offers unique features and capabilities that can enhance our LLM integration.

Next Steps:
1. I kindly request that all TIP LLM use cases be listed in our Azure DevOps (ADO) project.
2. We should schedule a brainstorming or planning session to discuss these use cases, evaluate the implementation libraries, and chart our path forward.

Your input on this matter is crucial. Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification to make an informed decision.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
