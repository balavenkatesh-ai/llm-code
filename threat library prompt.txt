"MITRE Tactic Description": "Buffer Overflow",
"MITRE Technique ID": "T1059.003",
"MITRE Technique Description": "Using a buffer overflow to execute malicious code.",
"Severity": "High",
"Likelihood": "Medium",
"Programming Threat Vectors": "Input validation and sanitization bypass",
"Social Engineering Threat Vectors": "Phishing or manipulation of system administrators to gain access to the RabbitMQ server.",
"L4 Control": "Implementing firewalls or intrusion detection systems to detect and block malicious traffic targeting the RabbitMQ server.",
