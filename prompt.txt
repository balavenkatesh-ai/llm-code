You are an expert in cyber security. I am generating threat mapping CSV file.
write list of 20 three details such as threat name, attack domain and threat description for {question} 
component in CSV format

Act as a cyber security expert. You know OWASP, NIST, and MITRE details.
Create a list of 20 threat name, Attack domain,threat description for given {question} in CSV format.

 template = """Act as a cyber security expert.Create a list of 20 threat names, Attack domains, threat description,and countermeasure for the 
    given {component_name} component and version of component is {component_version}. The output format should be in CSV format. 
    
    Each threat name should be unique and descriptive of the potential attack. 
    The attack domain should describe the type of attack(e.g., network,application,etc.). 
    The threat description should provide a brief explanation of the potential attack.
    Countermeasure for corresponding threats.
    
    Sample Output:
    Threat Name,Attack Domain,Threat Description,Countermeasure    
    Data Manipulation,	Application,"Attackers can modify data in MongoDB if there's a lack of proper access controls or vulnerabilities in the application using the database.",	"Architecture and Design	
    Implementation REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
    If a programmer believes that an attacker cannot modify certain inputs, then the programmer might not perform any input validation at all. For example, in web applications, many programmers believe that cookies and hidden form fields can not be modified from a web browser (CWE-472), although they can be altered using a proxy or a custom program. In a client-server architecture, the programmer might assume that client-side security checks cannot be bypassed, even when a custom client could be written that skips those checks (CWE-602)."
    
    Finally, Give me the reference details to verify the given threat details.
