            As a cyber security expert, your task is to prepare a list of {number_of_threat} threats.It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details you are given.
            <</SYS>>
            
            Provide Threat Names, Attack Domains, Threat Descriptions, Countermeasures, CAPEC Reference URLs, and References for the {component_name} component, version {component_version}.

            To structure your data, follow these guidelines:

            1. Threat Name: A descriptive name for each potential threat (e.g., Data Manipulation).
            2. Attack Domain: Specify the category of attack, such as network or application.
            3. Threat Description: Offer a concise explanation of the potential attack. For example, describe how attackers can manipulate data in MongoDB due to improper access controls or vulnerabilities in the application using the database.
            4. Countermeasure: Suggest recommendations to mitigate each threat.
            5. MITRE Tactics ID: Specify MITRE Tactics ID from the MITRE Website.
            5. MITRE Tactics Description: Specify MITRE Tactics Description from the MITRE Website.
            6. MITRE Techniques ID: Specify MITRE Techniques ID from the MITRE Website.
            6. MITRE Techniques Description: Specify MITRE Techniques Description from the MITRE Website.
            5. CAPEC Reference URL: Include the URL of the CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) database for each threat, linking to its CAPEC page.
            6. References: Provide reference source names or URLs to verify the accuracy of the threat information provided.
                        
            Note:- Your output should be in the pandas dataframe table format with the following given above columns. [/INST]

Stride GPT example

A web application that allows users to create, store, and share personal notes. 
The application is built using the React frontend framework and a Node.js backend with a MongoDB database. Users can sign up for an account and log in using OAuth2 with Google or Facebook. The notes are encrypted at rest and are only accessible by the user who created them. The application also supports real-time collaboration on notes with other users.

Application Name is Credit Information Management Solutions.
Application will be hosted on Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL 8x server.
Frontend will be deployed on Apache httpd Web Server and backend will deployed on Red Hat JBoss Web Server TOMCAT 5x.
Kong API gateway will be used as an API Gateway to expose the APIs to the UI. All the 
Java will be used as backend technology, and React will be used as Front end technology.
This application will be used as internal application and it will not be exposed to internet.
All of the inbound traffic will be exposed as https endpoints.
Few outbound requests uses wss (webs sockets), jms and https to fetch information other systems.

As we proceed with the development of a threat library for a new component using the LLM model, I have initiated an analysis to enhance LLM's performance in this scenario. As part of this process, I am currently preparing the dataset and would greatly benefit from assistance focusing on security considerations.

Threat ID Generation: Could you provide guidance on how Threat IDs are manually generated? What specific format should we adhere to when generating IDs for new components?

Threat Name and Description: Where can we locate the threat name and description for a given component name, along with its version? Which online resource is recommended for obtaining this initial set of information?

Attack Domain Details: Where can we find comprehensive details about the attack domain?

Countermeasures Information: How and where can we access information regarding countermeasures for a given threat description?

Severity Measurement: Could you clarify how severity is measured and correlated with threat details?

Likelihood Assessment: How is the likelihood of a threat being realized measured, and where can we find this data?

Programming Threat Vectors and Social Engineering Threat Vectors: Where can we obtain data on programming threat vectors and social engineering threat vectors?
