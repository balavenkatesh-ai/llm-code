            As a cyber security expert, your task is to prepare a list of {number_of_threat} threats.It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details you are given.
            <</SYS>>
            
            Provide Threat Names, Attack Domains, Threat Descriptions, Countermeasures, CAPEC Reference URLs, and References for the {component_name} component, version {component_version}.

            To structure your data, follow these guidelines:

            1. Threat Name: A descriptive name for each potential threat (e.g., Data Manipulation).
            2. Attack Domain: Specify the category of attack, such as network or application.
            3. Threat Description: Offer a concise explanation of the potential attack. For example, describe how attackers can manipulate data in MongoDB due to improper access controls or vulnerabilities in the application using the database.
            4. Countermeasure: Suggest recommendations to mitigate each threat.
            5. MITRE Tactics ID: Specify MITRE Tactics ID from the MITRE Website.
            5. MITRE Tactics Description: Specify MITRE Tactics Description from the MITRE Website.
            6. MITRE Techniques ID: Specify MITRE Techniques ID from the MITRE Website.
            6. MITRE Techniques Description: Specify MITRE Techniques Description from the MITRE Website.
            5. CAPEC Reference URL: Include the URL of the CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) database for each threat, linking to its CAPEC page.
            6. References: Provide reference source names or URLs to verify the accuracy of the threat information provided.
                        
            Note:- Your output should be in the pandas dataframe table format with the following given above columns. [/INST]
